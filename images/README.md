# Image Assets

Add your image files here:

- **background.png** – The game background (1920×1080px or larger recommended)
- **animal.png** – The character that moves around (180×240px recommended, or larger with same aspect ratio)
- **strawberry.png** – The strawberries to collect (100×100px recommended)
- **blueberry.png** – The blueberries (50×50px recommended)

## Tips

- Use PNG or JPG for the background (JPG is smaller for photos)
- Use PNG files with transparent backgrounds for characters and fruit
- Images can be larger than the recommended sizes for sharper display on retina screens
- Keep the aspect ratios consistent with the recommended dimensions
- The background will automatically scale to cover the full screen
