# Sound Effects

Add your audio files here to replace the built-in synthesized sounds:

- **collect.mp3** – Plays when the animal collects a strawberry (short, fun sound)
- **cheer.mp3** – Plays when the player collects all 5 strawberries (celebration sound)
- **error.mp3** – Plays when the animal tries to collect a blueberry (error/buzzer sound)

If these files are not present, the game will use simple synthesized tones instead.
