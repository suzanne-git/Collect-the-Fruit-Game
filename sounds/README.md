# Sound Effects

Add your audio files here to replace the built-in synthesized sounds:

- **collect.mp3** – Plays when the animal collects each fruit (short, fun sound)
- **cheer.mp3** – Plays when the player collects all 5 fruits (celebration sound)

If these files are not present, the game will use simple synthesized tones instead.
